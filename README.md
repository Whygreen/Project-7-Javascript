# Sprint 7 project
In this project I made HHTP requests with javascript to test Urban Grocers endpoints. I covered the four methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. For each method, I have created two tests. One test to check the response status code and another to parse the response and check that it contains the correct data. 
For this project, the technologies and techniques i used are javascript and jest.
To run the tests just use 'npm test'
