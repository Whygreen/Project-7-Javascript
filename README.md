# Sprint 7 project
In this project I made HHTP requests with javascript to test Urban Grocers endpoints. I covered the four methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. For each method, I have created two tests. One test to check the response status code and another to parse the response and check that it contains the correct data. 
For this project, the technologies and techniques i used are javascript and jest.
Before we begin testing, we need to install the project's dependencies with npm install.
Then we deployed the Urban Grocers server and copied it into the config.js file by replacing the template URL. 
To run the test suite just use 'npm test'
